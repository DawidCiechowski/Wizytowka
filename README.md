## How it Works

### General

The basic premise of the website, is that it uses React.js and CSS for the styling and interaction with the website objects. 
Node.js is used for the backend, along with the modules. React-router is responsible for handling the routing around the 
subroutes of the website. Furthermore, the website connects to personally developed API, to get information about the projects.
