## Introduction

A personal website, using Node.js, React.js and CSS, showcasing the information in regards to myself - Dawid Ciechowski - along
with information about my projects, skills and contact information. Personally, I do not have any previous experience with React,
hence the website may not be fully polished. 

### IMPORTANT!

Although the website may be online, during this time, the project is still in development stage, and many changes may occur.
Please do not consider this as a final product, as changes will be made regularly to update the look, functionality and other
aspects of the website.

## How it Works

### General

The basic premise of the website, is that it uses React.js and CSS for the styling and interaction with the website objects. 
Node.js is used for the backend, along with the modules. React-router is responsible for handling the routing around the 
subroutes of the website. Furthermore, the website connects to personally developed API, to get information about the projects.
